 # Challenge Summary
 The audit for this local congressional election revealed that the winner Diana DeGette won by a landslide,
 74% of total votes compared to the other two candidates.  The largest turnout of voters came from the
 Denver county with a representation of 83% of total votes.  A further analysis would be needed to understand if
 majority of the Denver county voted for Diana DeGetter, however considering she won by a large majority vote she
 probably obtained a substantial amount of votes from the Denver county.
